Main menu UI

Laturn light is the 7x7 viewport
	- decreases with time, can be replenished with new 'fuel' item type

Animations
	- Particle effects
	- Fire and water effects
		- I believe this is possible via GIF files in JavaFX
	- Goal/item pick-up animations

In-and-out fade-to-black effect between levels

If teleporters were 'loose ground' so to speak;
	- have the same effect with a message
	- for example: "you fall through the ground and discover a hidden passage to a new part of the cave"
	- Displays once per teleporter so as not to be repetitive

Torches in walls with 'lighting' effects (wall and floor check for wall-torch tile)
	- 'lighting' demo-ed in Graphics Mk_2.1
